  # # By default if there is a primary key present then rows in an index view are ordered by this primary key.  To
  # # use a different rule for doing ORDER BY, you can override this default ordering done by The Brick, for instance
  # # to have the rows in a contact list sorted by email:
  # Brick.order = { 'contacts' => { _brick_default: :email } }
  # # or by last name then first name:
  # Brick.order = { 'contacts' => { _brick_default: [:lastname, :firstname] } }
  # # Totally legitimate to have the default order be the name of a belongs_to or has_many association instead of an
  # # actual column name, in which case for has_many it just orders by the count of how many records are associated,
  # # and for belongs_to it's based on the primary table's DSL if any is defined (since that is what is used to
  # # calculate what is shown when a foreign table lists out related records).  If contacts relates to addresses,
  # # then this is perfectly fine:
  # Brick.order = { 'contacts' => { _brick_default: :address } }
  # # You can even have a specific custom clause used in the ORDER BY.  In this case it is recommended to include a
  # # special placeholder for the table name with the sequence \"^^^\".  Here is an example of having the default
  # # ordering happening on the \"code\" column, and also defining custom sorting to be done, in this case proper
  # # ordering if that code is stored as a dotted numeric value:
  # Brick.order = { 'document_trees' => { _brick_default: :code,
  #                                       code: \"ORDER BY STRING_TO_ARRAY(^^^.code, '.')::int[]\" } }

  # # columns show.  If there are any exclusions then all non-excluded columns are attempted to be shown,
  # # which negates the usefulness of inclusions except to add calculated column detail built from DSL.
  # # Designated by <table name>.<column name>
  # Brick.column_sequence = { 'users' =>   { include: ['email', 'profile.firstname', 'profile.lastname'] },

  # # in cases where your database for some reason does not have foreign key constraints defined.  Sometimes for
  # # performance reasons or just out of sheer laziness these might be missing.
  # # Each of these virtual foreign keys is defined as an array having three values:
  # #   foreign table name / foreign key column / primary table name.
  # # (We boldly expect that the primary key identified by ActiveRecord on the primary table will be accurate,
  # # usually this is \"id\" but there are some good smarts that are used in case some other column has been set
  # # to be the primary key.)

  #                          'orders' => { salesperson:  '[salesperson.first] [salesperson.last]',
  #                                        products:    ['[COUNT(order_items.product)] products', 'order_items.product' ] }
  #                        }

  # # Skip creating a has_many association for these (only retain the belongs_to built from this additional_reference).
  # # (Uses the same exact three-part format as would define an additional_reference)
  # # Say for instance that we didn't care to display the favourite colours that users have:
  # Brick.exclude_hms = [['users', 'favourite_colour_id', 'colours']]

  # # Skip showing counts for these specific has_many associations when building auto-generated #index views.
  # # When there are related tables with a significant number of records (generally 100,000 or more), this can lessen
  # # the load on the database considerably, sometimes fixing what might appear to be an index page that just \"hangs\"
  # # for no apparent reason.
  # Brick.skip_index_hms = ['User.litany_of_woes']

  # # By default primary tables involved in a foreign key relationship will indicate a \"has_many\" relationship pointing
  # # back to the foreign table.  In order to represent a \"has_one\" association instead, an override can be provided
  # # using the primary model name and the association name which you instead want to have treated as a \"has_one\":
  # Brick.has_ones = [['User', 'user_profile']]
  # # If you want to use an alternate name for the \"has_one\", such as in the case above calling the association \"profile\"
  # # instead of \"user_profile\", then apply that as a third parameter like this:
  # Brick.has_ones = [['User', 'user_profile', 'profile']]

  # # We normally don't show the timestamp columns \"created_at\", \"updated_at\", and \"deleted_at\", and also do
  # # not consider them when finding associative tables to support an N:M association.  (That is, ones that can be a
  # # part of a has_many :through association.)  If you want to use different exclusion columns than our defaults
  # # then this setting resets that list.  For instance, here is an override that is useful in the Sakila sample
  # # database:
  # Brick.metadata_columns = ['last_update']

  # # Columns for which to add a validate presence: true even though the database doesn't have them marked as NOT NULL.
  # # Designated by <table name>.<column name>
  # Brick.not_nullables = ['users.name']

  # # FRIENDLY DSL

  # # A simple DSL is available to allow more user-friendly display of objects.  Normally a user object might be shown
  # # as its first non-metadata column, or if that is not available then something like \"User #45\" where 45 is that
  # # object's ID.  If there is no primary key then even that is not possible, so the object's .to_s method is called.
  # # To override these defaults and specify exactly what you want shown, such as first names and last names for a
  # # user, then you can use model_descrips like this, putting expressions with property references in square brackets:
  # Brick.model_descrips = { 'User' => '[profile.firstname] [profile.lastname]' }

  # # SINGLE TABLE INHERITANCE

  # # Specify STI subclasses either directly by name or as a general module prefix that should always relate to a specific
  # # parent STI class.  The prefixed :: here for these examples is mandatory.  Also having a suffixed :: means instead of
  # # a class reference, this is for a general namespace reference.  So in this case requests for, say, either of the
  # # non-existent classes Animals::Cat or Animals::Goat (or anything else with the module prefix of \"Animals::\" would
  # # build a model that inherits from Animal.  And a request specifically for the class Snake would build a new model
  # # that inherits from Reptile, and no other request would do this -- only specifically for Snake.  The ending ::
  # # indicates that it's a module prefix instead of a specific class name.
  # Brick.sti_namespace_prefixes = { '::Animals::' => 'Animal',
  #                                  '::Snake' => 'Reptile' }

  # # Custom inheritance_column to be used for STI.  This is by default \"type\", and applies to all models.  With this
  # # option you can change this either for specific models, or apply a new overall name generally:

  # Brick.sti_type_column = { 'rails_type' => ['sales.specialoffer'] }

  # # POLYMORPHIC ASSOCIATIONS

  # # Polymorphic associations are set up by providing a model name and polymorphic association name#{poly}

  # # For multi-tenant databases that use a separate schema for each tenant, a single representative database schema
  # # can be analysed to determine the range of polymorphic classes that can be used for each association.  Hopefully
  # # the schema chosen is one loaded with existing data that is representative of all possible polymorphic

  # # route to go to the :index action for what would be a controller for that table.  You can specify any controller
  # # name and action you wish in order to override this and have that be the default route when none other has been
  # # specified in routes.rb or elsewhere.  (Or just use an empty string in order to disable this behaviour.)
